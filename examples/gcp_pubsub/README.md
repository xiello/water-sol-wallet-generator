## INTRODUCTION
This example demonstrates an implementation of the vanity wallet generator with Google Pub/Sub. To run this project, create a GCP project and enable Google Pub/Sub. Google Pub/Sub has a generous free tier plan, available [here](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/pricing).

## SETTING UP GCP PUB/SUB TOPICS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
1. Create topics - There are three topics that we need to create, listed below:
-  **generate**: To send the generate events 
-  **on_generated**: To send the generated key response
-  **on_error**: To send the error events

2. Create subscription - There are three subscriptions we need to create, listed below:
- **generate-sub**: To subscribe and listen to generate topic
- **on_generated-sub**: To subscribe and listen to responses generated by the generate-sub subscription on generate topic
- **on_error-sub**: To subscribe and listen to errors generated by the generate-sub subscription on generate topic.

## UPDATING CREDENTIALS AND PROJECT ID
1. **CREDENTIALS**: Once all topics and subscriptions are set up, provision a service account for authentication. After creating the service account, create a JSON key and paste it into `examples/gcp_pubsub/credentials.json`.
2. **PROJECT_ID**: Update the `PROJECT_ID` variable in both `main.py` and `publisher.py`.

## INSTALLATION
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## RUN THE PROJECT
1. Run the generator
```
python3 main.py
```

2. Publish a generate event
```
python3 publisher.py
```
