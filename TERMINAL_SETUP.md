# Terminal Setup (Quick)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiello/water-sol-wallet-generator.git
cd water-sol-wallet-generator
npm start
```

Notes:
- `npm start` creates `.venv` and installs missing Python packages automatically on first run.
- On macOS, non-technical users can run `bash ./setup-mac.command` once and then `bash ./start.command`.
- Wallet files are saved in `./keys`.
- Keep private key JSON files offline and never share them.
